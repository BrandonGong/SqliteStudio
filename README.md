# SqliteStudio
Simple GUI for managing SQLite databases. The tool shows the schema of the database including tables and columns. 
It also provides a query window that allows the user to run queries against the database. 

## How to use
Open a database file by clicking the Open Database button, then navigate to the file you want to open. 
The database schema can be viewed in the left-hand object explorer. Queries can be written in the right-hand
text window. To run the query, either click the Run button or press F5.
